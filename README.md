# TinyGrad Experiments

This repository contains experimental implementations using the TinyGrad framework, focusing on neural network architectures and learning algorithms.

## Current Implementations

### Hebbian Learning on MNIST
- Single-layer Hebbian learning implementation
- Trains on MNIST dataset
- Uses TinyGrad's tensor operations and JIT compilation
- Currently processes single samples for both training and testing

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies (TinyGrad and its requirements)
3. Run experiments:
```bash
python hebbian_mnist.py
```

## Project Structure
- `hebbian_mnist.py`: Main implementation of Hebbian learning on MNIST
- More implementations coming soon...

## Development Status
This is an active research project, exploring various neural network architectures and learning algorithms using TinyGrad.
